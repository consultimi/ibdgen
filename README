# IBD Generator

A Rust library for generating Incomplete Block Designs (IBDs) with prohibitions. This is a port of the IBD generation code from the AlgDesign R package.

## Features

- Generate optimal incomplete block designs (IBDs)
- Support for prohibited treatment pairs
- Configurable parameters:
  - Number of treatments (v)
  - Number of blocks (n_b) 
  - Block size (k)
  - Number of iterations
  - Number of repeats per iteration

## Usage

To use the library, you can call the `ibdgen` function with the desired parameters. Here's an example:

```rust
let result = ibdgen(v, n_b, block_size, iter, n_repeats, prohibited_pairs);
```

This will generate an IBD with the specified parameters and return the best solution found.
